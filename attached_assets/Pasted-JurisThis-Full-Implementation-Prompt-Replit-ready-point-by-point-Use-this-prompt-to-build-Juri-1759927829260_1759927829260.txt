JurisThis — Full Implementation Prompt (Replit-ready, point-by-point)

Use this prompt to build JurisThis: a ChatGPT-style web app for Indian law (lawyers, students, firms). It contains everything we discussed: UI/UX, frontend, backend, data models, AI logic (RAG + LLM), templates, integrations, security, deployment, team & roadmap. Paste into your Replit / GitHub Copilot / dev brief and use as a single source-of-truth.

1) High-level summary (one line)

JurisThis — ChatGPT-style web app + case/project workspaces that provides: Case Law Search + Verified Summaries, Judgment Analysis & Simplification, Draft Generator (legal templates), IPC↔BNS mapping, Bare Act explanations, Citation verification and secure, auditable workflows tailored for Indian law.

2) Primary product principles (short)

Chat-first UX (exactly like ChatGPT) with a left sidebar for New Chat, Search, Case Folders, Features and History.

Case Folder (Project) mode: all chats, uploads, drafts in a folder are context-scoped (assistant uses only that folder’s files unless user opts otherwise).

Grounded outputs: every factual/legal claim must be sourceable and verifiable.

Modular, production-grade: clear APIs, RBAC, encryption, observability.

3) Top features (Phase 1 MVP)

Public Interest Litigation (PIL) basic form

Criminal Complaint (private complaint)

Employment Contract (basic)

Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)

General Court Affidavit

4) UI / UX — ChatGPT faithful with legal additions (exact layout & behaviors)
Layout (desktop)

Left sidebar (persistent) top → bottom:

+ New Chat (starts a general chat)

Search chats... (global quick search)

Case Folders (collapsible): + Create Case Folder then list of folders (name / unread badge / quick actions)

Previous Chats (history)

Features (pinned tools): Draft Generator, Judgment Analysis, IPC↔BNS, Bare Act Explorer, Citation Verifier

Settings, Help, Billing

Top bar: global search (across cases + laws), user/profile menu, notifications

Main pane: Chat area (streaming replies). If inside folder, header shows folder name + “folder mode” badge.

Right panel (collapsible): Sources Used, Attached Documents, Quick Tools (Generate draft / Verify citations), Folder Memory

Bottom input bar:

Mode tabs: General | Case | Drafting | Statute Explanation

Attach button (files), tone selector, send button, prompt templates quick menu

Chat response card structure

Every assistant reply must include:

Short Quick Answer (1–2 lines)

Structured sections (if applicable): Metadata (case/court/date), Facts, Issues, Decision/Reasoning, Statutes, Precedents (with clickable citations), Confidence & Verification status.

Action row: Save to Folder / Generate Draft / Verify Citations / Export / Add note.

Case Folder behavior (important)

Creating Folder = mini-workspace. User uploads docs (FIRs, judgments). Folder memory stores named facts (ClientName, ArrestDate, CaseNo).

While in a folder, assistant RAG retrieval prioritizes folder docs and then global corpora.

Folder privacy: Private (user only) or Firm (shared among org members). Audit trail for each access.

Draft Generator UI flow (detailed)

User selects Draft Generator > chooses a draft type (Top 10 visible + search).

System auto-renders a dynamic form from template requiredInputs[] (placeholders).

User can: (a) lazy fill minimal fields or (b) attach supporting docs to auto-extract facts.

Click Generate Draft → streaming generation → shows draft in rich text editor (TipTap/Quill) with inline placeholders highlighted.

Buttons: Verify citations, Save to Case Folder, Export DOCX/PDF, Submit for Review (approval workflow).

5) Frontend tech & implementation notes

Framework: React (Vite or Next.js for server rendering)

Styling: Tailwind CSS + component library (shadcn/ui or Material UI)

Editor: TipTap (rich text, extension enabled for legal formatting)

State & Data: React Query / SWR for server data; local session cache for streaming responses

Websocket/Streaming: Use WebSocket (or SSE) to stream assistant responses for live typing feel.

File uploads: chunked multipart to S3-compatible storage; show progress.

Accessibility: keyboard shortcuts matching ChatGPT (New Chat Ctrl+N, Search /, Toggle panel).

CI: GitHub Actions (lint, tests, build, deploy).

6) Backend architecture (microservices recommended)

Services & responsibilities:

API Gateway / Auth (Node.js / Express or FastAPI): routes, rate limits, JWT/OAuth, SSO (firm SAML optional).

Chat Orchestrator / Orchestration Layer (Node/Python): handles chat sessions, manages RAG pipeline, builds prompts, collects sources, ensures grounded generation.

Retrieval Service (Elasticsearch + Vector DB): keyword search (ES) + semantic search (vector DB: Pinecone / Weaviate / PGVector). Embedding worker generates/updates embeddings.

LLM Service (hosted or API): calls to OpenAI GPT-4/Claude or self-hosted Llama2/LLama-like models for generation and summarization. Use an orchestration to choose model & cost control.

Citation Verifier (Python microservice): performs multi-source lookups (licensed SCC/Manupatra via partner API or IndianKanoon & court websites), returns verified status & para refs.

Template & Draft Service (Node/Python): loads JSON templates, renders drafts, versioning.

Storage:

Relational DB (Postgres) for users, orgs, folders, metadata.

Vector DB (Pinecone/Weaviate/PGVector) for embeddings.

Document store (S3) for PDFs, DOCX.

Admin & Billing Service: plans, seats, usage.

Audit & Logging: ELK or Datadog + DB logs for every generation/verification action.

7) Data model (essential tables / JSON entities)

Minimal key tables/objects (Postgres):

users {id, org_id, email, name, role, mfa, created_at}

orgs {id, name, plan, license_info}

folders {id, org_id, name, jurisdiction, privacy, members, created_at}

documents {id, folder_id, title, source, uploaded_by, metadata{court,date,bench,citation}, s3_url, chunks_count}

vectors stored in vector DB with metadata doc_id, chunk_index, para_range

chats {id, folder_id|null, title, created_by}

messages {id, chat_id, role, text, attachments, sources[], verification_status}

drafts {id, folder_id, template_id, content_html, content_text, citations[], version, status}

templates {id, category, title, requiredInputs[], template[]}

8) RAG & LLM logic — concrete flow (per query)

User sends query (text or file). Detect mode: search, judgment analysis, drafting, statute.

Query normalization: expand legal synonyms, detect citation/section numbers.

Retriever:

Sparse: Elasticsearch (BM25) for exact matches & filters (court, year).

Dense: embed query (SBERT/OpenAI embeddings) → vector DB nearest neighbors (top N).

Context assembly: select 3–8 best chunks (prioritize folder docs if in folder), attach metadata (doc id, para numbers).

Prompt construction: system prompt (mode-specific) + retrieved chunks + user query. Include strict instructions: “Only assert claims found in the provided chunks; if missing, return ‘Insufficient Source’.”

LLM call: stream response. Attach sources & snippet references in output.

Post-check: Citation Verifier checks every cited case/section — update message verification_status & confidence.

Return: response with structured sections and actionable buttons.

9) Example system prompts (copy-paste ready)
Draft Generator system prompt
SYSTEM:
You are JurisThis Draft Assistant (Indian law). Given: [TEMPLATE] and [USER_INPUTS], produce a legally formatted [DOCUMENT_TYPE] in formal Indian legal English. Maintain structure: TITLE, PARTIES, FACTS, GROUNDS, PRAYER. Do NOT invent case citations. If a statute/section is referenced in inputs, include exact section text and mark for verification. Where information is missing, insert [INSERT: fieldName]. Output draft then JSON metadata: {missing_fields:[], suggested_statutes:[], citations_found:[]}.

Judgment Summarizer system prompt
SYSTEM:
You are a legal summarizer specialized in Indian judgments. Using the provided context chunks only, produce: 1) 2-line executive summary; 2) Facts (3–6 bullets); 3) Issues (numbered); 4) Decision (1–2 bullets); 5) Reasoning (concise); 6) RatioDecidendi vs Obiter (tag sentences). Always include Sources with doc_id & paragraph numbers. If info not in context, reply: "Insufficient source material".

Citation Verifier prompt
SYSTEM:
You are a citation verification microservice. For each citation string, search licensed DBs (SCC/Manupatra) or fallback public sources (IndianKanoon, High Court sites). Return: {citationString, found:true|false, doc_id, para_from, para_to, excerpt, overruled:true|false, source_url}. If not found, mark found:false.

10) Draft templates — how to store (JSON structure)

Each template file (example bail_application.json) shape:

{
  "id": "bail_application",
  "category": "Court Petitions",
  "title": "Bail Application",
  "description": "Regular/anticipatory/interim bail form",
  "requiredInputs": ["CourtName","CaseNumber","PetitionerName","AccusedName","OffenceSections","Facts","Grounds","Sureties","Prayer"],
  "template": [
    {"heading":"IN THE [CourtName]","content":""},
    {"heading":"Case No.","content":"[CaseNumber]"},
    {"heading":"Applicant","content":"[PetitionerName] / [AccusedName]"},
    {"heading":"Facts","content":"[Facts]"},
    {"heading":"Grounds","content":"[Grounds]"},
    {"heading":"Prayer","content":"[Prayer]"},
    {"heading":"Verification","content":"I, [PetitionerName], state the facts are true."}
  ],
  "uiHints": {
    "formFields": {
      "OffenceSections": {"type":"tags","placeholder":"Section numbers (e.g., 420 IPC)"},
      "Facts": {"type":"textarea","maxChars":3000}
    }
  }
}

11) Citation sources & licensing (legal note)

Prefer licensing SCC/Manupatra for production (pay for API/data feed). Flag to investors that this is necessary for SCC-level verification.

Fallback to IndianKanoon and Court websites for public data. Always show provenance and licensing status in UI.

12) Security, privacy & compliance (must haves)

TLS everywhere, AES-256 at rest, KMS for key management.

RBAC + tenant isolation (org_id in every DB row).

Option to disable learning on private data (no training on user uploads unless opt-in).

Audit trail: who generated what, when, and with what inputs.

PII redaction tool before saving (configurable).

Data retention policy & export for compliance.

13) Observability & monitoring

Log requests, LLM calls, vector queries. Track hallucination flags and citation verification failure rate.

Metrics: query latency, cost per token, patents (LLM usage), drafts generated, conversion (trial→paid).

Alerting for model errors and quota thresholds.

14) Deployment & infra (recommended)

Containers: Docker + Kubernetes (GKE / EKS) for scalable model serving.

Serverless: Use functions (AWS Lambda) for light tasks (ingestion).

Vector DB: Pinecone or Weaviate or PGVector on RDS.

Embeddings: batch worker on GPU/CPU VMs.

LLM API: OpenAI for MVP; later consider self-hosted for cost control (Llama2 / Mistral) using Triton or vLLM.

Storage: AWS S3 / GCP bucket for documents.

CDN: for static assets.

15) Team & roles (minimum for 6-month road map)

Founders: CEO (legal domain + product), CTO (technical lead)

Core hires (immediate):

1 Full-stack Engineer (React + Node/FastAPI)

1 NLP/ML Engineer (embedding pipeline, prompt engineering)

1 Backend Engineer (search & infra)

1 Legal Content Lead (ex-lawyer) to create templates & validate outputs

1 DevOps/Platform Engineer

Advisors: Senior litigation partner, data privacy counsel, ML ethics advisor

Later hires: Sales/BD (pilot law firms), Customer Success, QA.

16) Roadmap & milestones (6 months)

Month 0–1: Core infra, UI skeleton (ChatGPT style), authentication, basic chat.

Month 2: Document ingestion + vector DB + case folder MVP. Implement top 10 draft templates JSON + Draft UI form.

Month 3: RAG search + Case Law Search + basic summarizer.

Month 4: Judgment Analysis pipeline + Citation Verifier integration (IndianKanoon).

17) Example API endpoints (minimal)

POST /api/auth/login

POST /api/folders (create case folder)

POST /api/folders/:id/upload (upload doc)

GET /api/search?q=&court=&year= (sparse + dense combined)

POST /api/analysis/judgment {doc_id|text} → returns structured JSON (timeline, facts, issues, ratio)

POST /api/drafts/generate {template_id, folder_id, inputs} → returns draft_id, content_html

POST /api/verify-citations {citations[]} → verification statuses

GET /api/templates (list templates)

GET /api/usage (admin)

18) Cost & seed ask (short guidance for pitch)

MVP 6 months hiring 5 people + infra + data licenses: estimate ₹1.5–3.0 Crore (ballpark) depending on licensing (SCC/Manupatra) and LLM API spend. Break down to payroll, cloud, data licenses and marketing. (Refine before pitch.)

19) Developer / Copilot usage snippet (for immediate coding)

Use this prompt as a header in your code-repo or paste into Copilot to generate routes / components:

PROJECT: JurisThis — AI Legal Assistant (India)
TASK: Implement Draft Generator form component in React that:
- loads template JSON from /api/templates
- renders dynamic form fields from requiredInputs
- validates required fields
- posts to /api/drafts/generate
- shows streaming draft in editor when returned
- allows Save to Case Folder and Export
Follow UI/UX spec: ChatGPT-like layout, bottom input has mode tabs, left sidebar case folders.

20) Quick acceptance tests (what to verify)

Create Case Folder → upload judgment PDF → ingest and index → query “Summarize judgment” → output must include Facts, Issues, Decision, Sources with paragraph refs.

New Chat (general) asking a statute question → returns Bare Act explanation + linked statute.

Draft Generator: fill minimal fields for Bail App → generate professional formatted draft with [INSERT] placeholders only where input blank.

Citation Verifier: for a generated citation, verify found/overruled status.

21) Next immediate actions for devs
